# One-Function-to-Rule-them-All
Here we provide a pre-built R script and R Shiny application for identifying abnormally large perikymata from measurements and calculating the age-at-defect by individual and by tooth. Make sure you have downloaded both "The One Ring Shiny.R" and "One Function to Rule Them All.R" into the same working directory or the code will not run.
